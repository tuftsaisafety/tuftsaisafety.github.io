                            <br><br>
                            The Fletcher School at Tufts is hosting a talk on <b>AI, Warfare and the Law</b> by Bill Boothby <b>tomorrow at 12pm in Mugar 200!</b>

                            Talk description:
                            <br>
                            Earlier this year Bill Boothby published his new book about AI, Warfare and the Law. One of the purposes of the text is to identify what artificial intelligence in the form of autonomous weapons and support to human decision-making must reliably do if it is to be legally acceptable. A second purpose is to work out who can be held legally responsible if things go wrong. Bill will explain some of the issues he grappled with when writing the book and will probably pose as many questions as he answers.
