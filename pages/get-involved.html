            <li><strong><a href="/programs/">Technical Fellowship</a></strong>: Technical foundations of frontier AI, including
                model architecture, interpretability, robustness, oversight, and more.</li>

                the most important AI risks.</li>

        <p>Both programs are self-contained (no outside readings required) and include meals. Open to
            undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs. Questions? <a
