                <p>Our technical fellowship is an 8-week, in-person reading group that meets for 1.5hrs/wk to cover the foundations of
                    frontier AI technology with topics like model interpretability, goal misgeneralization,
                    reinforcement learning, oversight, and more.</p>
                <p>The program is self-contained with no outside readings required and catered dinner/lunch is
                    provided. The fellowship is open to undergraduates, graduate students, and postdocs looking
                    to learn more about technical AI safety. Please direct questions to <a
