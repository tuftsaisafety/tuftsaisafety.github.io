            <h3>What is a Policy Hackathon?</h3>
            <p>
                The Tufts AI Safety x Tech@Fletcher Policy Hackathon allows participants to work in
                teams to develop creative policy solutions to problems posed by AI governance
                challenges. Participants -- whether undergraduate, graduate, or law students; more
                policy or tech-oriented -- will gain hands-on experience by writing policy briefs
                informed by technological expertise that address serious AI risks.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is a weekend-long event focused on producing actionable policy recommendations.
                Teams of 4-5 people will collaborate to write a 3-5 page policy proposal based on
                their selected track.
            </p>
            <p>
                Background articles, reading materials, and other resources will be provided for
                both tracks to ensure all teams have the necessary context to succeed.

            <h3>Why Participate?</h3>
            <p>
                Policy hackathons offer a unique opportunity for participants to not only build the
                specialized knowledge and career capital to succeed in AI governance but to also
                craft meaningful policy proposals. Through feedback from our expert judges and
                network, your work can serve as a tangible first step toward real-world adoption and
                agenda setting. Additionally, winning submissions will be published on our website
                for reference.

                    <p>
                        As AI capabilities advance, the governance landscape remains sparsely
                        populated by those with deep technical understanding. Your background places
                        you in a unique position to identify specific failure modes and technical
                        constraints that other policymakers might miss.

                    <p>
                        Effective AI policy is not designed in a vacuum. By collaborating with
                        technical experts, you will gain crucial intuition for how these systems
                        actually work, allowing you to craft regulations that are both technically
                        grounded and politically resilient.

                        <p>
                            <b>Background:</b> The development of frontier AI presents a distinct
                            collective action problem, where competitive pressures may incentivize
                            states and/or firms to prioritize rapid capability gains over safety
                            protocols. Because the risks of AI are global in scale, the current lack
                            of international coordination means there is a high probability that AI
                            development will shift to jurisdictions with the lowest safety barriers,
                            effectively nullifying strict domestic policies and continuing an AI
                            capabilities "arms race". Without a coherent international framework,
                            the global community faces the risk of a race to the bottom, where the
                            externalities of unsafe AI deployment cannot be contained by any single
                            nation.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            <b>Task:</b> Create an international governance body or treaty for AI
                            that survives the challenges of treaty verification and the realities of
                            great power politics, sovereignty, and the international stage as a
                            whole. Produce a policy brief justifying this proposal through clear and
                            feasible enforcement mechanisms, historical precedent, and reference to
                            existing international AI governance frameworks.

                        <p>
                            <b>Background:</b> The integration of artificial intelligence into
                            cybersecurity and biological sciences fundamentally alters the threat
                            landscape by significantly lowering the barrier to entry for
                            sophisticated attacks. As noted in recent reports, advanced models can
                            act as operational force multipliers, allowing non-expert actors to
                            overcome complex knowledge bottlenecks required to synthesize pathogens
                            or execute multi-stage cyber operations. This profound dual-use problem
                            -- where tools designed for normal scientific discovery can be
                            repurposed for harm -- threatens to destabilize the strategic balance by
                            accelerating the proliferation of offensive capabilities faster than
                            defensive measures can adapt.

                            <b>Task:</b> Design a policy framework to prevent, deter, or respond to
                            AI-enabled cyber, chemical, or biological risks. Proposals should tackle
                            governance gaps like attribution, liability, and incident reporting by
                            pitching a new regulatory body, mandatory set of standards, or
                            disclosure mechanisms.
